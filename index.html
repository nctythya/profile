        <h3>What is cyber security?</h3>
        <h4>What is a hacker?</h4>
        <div class = "description">
          <p>A hacker is an individual who uses computer, networking or other skills to
            overcome a technical problem. The term also may refer to anyone who uses their
            abilities to gain unauthorized access to systems or networks in order to commit crimes. A hacker may,
            for example, steal information to hurt people via identity theft or bring down a
            system and, often, hold it hostage in order to collect a ransom.</p>
            <p>
              <em>The term hacker</em> has historically been a divisive one, sometimes being used as a term of admiration for individuals
              ÃŸwho exhibit a high degree of skill and creativity in their approach to technical problems. However,
              the term is also commonly applied to individuals who use this skill for illegal or unethical purposes.
